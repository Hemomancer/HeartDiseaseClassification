Cardiovascular disease and heart disease all refer to various heart conditions. Examples of diseases under the heart disease umbrella include conditions like coronary artery disease. Every year, about 17.9 million people die from heart disease. Apart from this, there are many factors that raise one's risk of heart disease. Here we create a suitable machine learning technique which classify the heart disease more accurately, it is very helpful to the health organisation as well as patients.
